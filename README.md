Project Description
---
Our team's data visualization project is geography map vis of all approved/licensed/permitted alcohol venues in Boston (venues include restaurants, bars, grocery stores, so forth). Each venue is selectable, and upon selection retrieves a list of already-gathered tweets from Twitter that are around that geographic location.

We wanted to present an exploratory view of the authorized liquor venues in the city of Boston. We, as well as many other connoisseurs in Boston, enjoy a refreshing drink at a bar of our personal preference. We hope this website visualization (and potential future updates) presents some interesting discoveries about the licensed bars/venues in Boston.
